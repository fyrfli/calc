# Javascript Calculator by [@fyrfli](https://fyrfli.io)

I am using the standard basic calculator app to help me learn about javascript in conjunction with the DOM.

Building the interface was the easy part. Basic inputs and styling.

The hard part is the javascript. I have a background foundational knowledge of programming, but it's been a really long time since I've written procedural code. Doing it while learning a new language is as challenging as I remember it to be. But I am enjoying it immensely.
